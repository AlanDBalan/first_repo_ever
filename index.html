    <p>It's difficult to give an exact number for how many bees die and are born each year because the populations of bees can vary widely depending on factors such as geography, climate, and beekeeping practices. However, I can provide some general information on bee populations and their life cycles.

        A healthy honey bee colony can have anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000 bees during peak season. In the winter, the colony will typically dwindle to between 5,000 to 15,000 bees. Bees have a relatively short lifespan, with worker bees living for about 4-6 weeks during the summer and up to 6 months during the winter.
        
        Each spring, a new queen bee is typically born in the hive, and she will begin laying eggs. During peak season, a queen bee can lay up to 2,000 eggs per day. These eggs will hatch into larvae, which will then go through several stages of development before emerging as adult bees.
        
        Unfortunately, bee populations have been in decline in recent years due to factors such as habitat loss, pesticide use, and disease. According to the Bee Informed Partnership, which tracks honey bee colony losses in the United States, beekeepers lost an estimated 45.5% of their managed honey bee colonies between April 2020 and April 2021. However, wild bee populations are more difficult to track, and there is still much that is unknown about their populations and life cycles.
